This study aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different PCV13 dosing schedules among children under five years of age using observational healthcare records over a network of data sources. 
We will use a trial emulation method, clone censor weight analysis, to estimate the relative risk of clinical outcomes of interest between different PCV13 dosing schedules. 

This study is particularly relevant and time-sensitive as the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) who will provide recommendation in **early 2025** about switching from the existing 2+1 or 3+0 PCV dosing schedules to the 1+1 schedule. 
The WHO SAGE group have been gathering data to investigate the potential impact of this change, and results of this large-scale real-world study will be able to provide supporting evidence.
